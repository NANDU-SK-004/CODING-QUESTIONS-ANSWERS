## Question Description 

- **Description   :**
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]

Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]

Output: 1

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-3 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

## Solution

- **Code           :**
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
     int ans = 0;
     for(int i : nums){
        ans = ans ^ i;
     } 
     return ans;  
    }
};
